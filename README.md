## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personal-portfolio.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd personal-portfolio
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application will open in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. The page will reload when you make changes, and you may see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) documentation for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and filenames include hashes.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.
